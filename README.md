### Upcoming features
* Global accesors - (viz - "GameRules", "Convars") I have the code setup to do that, but wasnt sure of all accesors at this point. Will add that in soon
* KV Expansions - A fake language syntax that makes adding KVs much easier. (KV = .txt files in scripts\npc\npc_xyz_custom.txt)
* Timers - I am considering adding [BMD's barebones](https://github.com/bmddota/barebones) timers as snippets.
